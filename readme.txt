Easily display a textwidget on a set time and/or day.

== Description ==
The Timed Textwidget allows you to specify a set time and days when the textwidget should be displayed. For example: you set the start time to \'11:00\' and the end time to \'13:00\'. The widget will only be visible between these set times. You can also select on which days the widget should be visible.

The easiest way to time your textwidgets.
