Easily display a textwidget on a set time and/or day.

== Description ==

This timed widget allows you to specify a set time and days when the textwidget should be displayed. For example: you set the start time to '11:00' and the end time to '13:00'. The widget will only be visible between these set times. You can also select on which days the widget should be visible.

The easiest way to time your textwidgets.

Translation in dutch (more coming soon).
